    <h1>How Does Writing CSS Differ From Writing HTML?</h1>
  
      <p>
        <h>As we write CSS these are the type of questions we might ask ourselves:</h>

      <ul>

        <li Should the layout of the text be in a single or double column?</li>
        <li Should we use a different font color for the header?</li>
        <li How should the same content appear differently on a desktop versus a mobile device?</li>
      
      </ul>

      <h>All of the questions above deal with the aesthetic considerations of the page. These are the concerns of the presentation layer (CSS).</h>
      <h>As a contrast, let's consider the type of questions we might ask ourselves as we write HTML:</h>

      <ul>
       
        <li>Does the order of items within a list matter? Should it be a numbered list?</li>
        <li> we wrap a list of links inside a navigation tag?</li>
        <li>Is this the most important header in the whole HTML document?</li>
       
        </ul>

      <h>The last few questions deal with structure, hierarchy, and meaning. These are the concerns of the content layer (HTML).</h>
      <h>When we write CSS, we focus on aesthetic and display considerations. When we write HTML, we focus on structure, hierarchy, and meaning.</h>
